            <h2>Who is the Mercenary?</h2>
            <p>In Risk of Rain 2, by Hopoo Games, the Mercenary is a playable character. One of 3 truly melee survivors (alongside Loader and Acrid), he is a
            Katana-wielding cyborg ninja who can dash around and become invulnerable in order to chop up his opponents. He is also the only survivor in the game
            who can double-jump without use of a Hopoo feather, meaning that he can get double the use out of a wax quail when compared to anyone else.</p>

            <h2>How do I get this Mercenary?</h2>
            <div id="griddy">
                <p>The Mercenary can be unlocked by choosing the "obliteration" ending of a playthrough, meaning he is not a character that would be immediately available to new players.
                This is done by entering the Celestial Portal which appears every 5 stages, starting from the 8th. Taking it instead of the normal teleporter will lead you
                to the Hidden Realm "A Moment, Fractured", which contains a massive obelisk. Reaching and interacting with the obelisk will allow you to Obliterate yourself from existence,
                ending the run and granting you a "Fate Unknown" ending, which counts as a victory for the purposes of completing each survivor's "Mastery" achievement. The "first" time you do this, however,
                you will also be rewarded with the "True Respite" achievement, whose reward is the Mercenary.</p>

        <h2>Why I think he's cool</h2>
        <div id="legrid">
            <p>I Just think that running around as a cyborg ninja with dashes, a double jump, and a laser sword is pretty cool. His gameplay is super high-octane
                since you need to be in the fray to do all your damage unless you are running Slicing Winds or have some very strong ranged items. The adrenaline
                rush I get while doing well with him is just so much higher than anything I get with any other character in the game.
