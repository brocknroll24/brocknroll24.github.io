            <h2>Who is the Mercenary?</h2>
            <p>In Risk of Rain 2, by Hopoo Games, the Mercenary is a playable character. One of 3 truly melee survivors (alongside Loader and Acrid), he is a
            Katana-wielding cyborg ninja</p>

            <h2>How do I get this Mercenary?</h2>
            <p>The Mercenary can be unlocked by choosing the "obliteration" ending of a playthrough, meaning he is not a character that would be immediately available to new players.
                This is done by entering the Celestial Portal which appears every 5 stages, starting from the 8th. Taking it instead of the normal teleporter will lead you
                to the Hidden Realm "A Moment, Fractured", which contains a massive obelisk. Reaching and interacting with the obelisk will allow you to Obliterate yourself from existence,
                ending the run and granting you a "Fate Unknown" ending, which counts as a victory for the purposes of completing each survivor's "Mastery" achievement. The first time you do this, however,
                you will also be rewarded with the "True Respite" achievement, whose reward is the Mercenary.</p>
